# Deep Dive — Docker Build & Compose

This document explains the complete Docker path: detection, unified compose generation, build, start/health, logs, and teardown.

## Detection

- Repos marked as Docker mode (globally or per-repo) are scanned for a `Dockerfile`.
- If found, a Docker service entry is prepared with ports from `ports-map.json` (preferred) or from `EXPOSE` lines.

```text
63:86:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
if (fs.existsSync(dockerfilePath)) {
  this.logger.info(`🐳 Found Dockerfile in ${repo}`);
  const serviceName = this.slug(repo);
  if (this.portsMap[serviceName]) { ports = [`${host}:${internal}`]; }
  else { ports = await this.extractPortsFromDockerfile(dockerfilePath); }
}
```

For .NET projects, if a compose file exists in the repo, startup/install default to docker-compose commands:

```text
490:521:src/modes/execution/services/FrameworkDetector.ts
const hasDockerCompose = fs.existsSync(docker-compose.yml|yaml|compose.yml|yaml)
if (hasDockerCompose) return "docker-compose up";
```

## Unified compose generation

- Required infra services (Redis/RabbitMQ/Postgres/TimescaleDB) are added based on env resolution.
- App services (detected Dockerfiles) are added with `build.context`, `ports`, `depends_on`, `networks`, `volumes`.
- Result is serialized to `docker-compose.unified.yml` in the current working directory.

```text
176:205:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
if (requiredInfraServices && requiredInfraServices.size > 0) {
  // add infra services with healthchecks, volumes, ports
}
```

```text
311:329:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
unifiedCompose.services[service.name] = { build, ports, depends_on, ... };
const composeContent = yaml.dump(unifiedCompose, { indent: 2, lineWidth: 120 });
```

```text
375:385:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), "docker-compose.unified.yml"), composeContent, "utf-8");
```

## Build

- Services are built with:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml build --progress=plain
```

- The logger tracks steps, percent progress, pulls, and errors; suggests remedies on failures.

```text
537:545:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
const dockerCompose = spawn("docker-compose", ["-f", composePath, "build", "--progress=plain"]);
```

## Start & health

- Services are started with:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d
```

- Health is waited for per service (healthy status or running if no healthcheck) with timeout and heartbeats.

```text
764:771:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
const dockerCompose = spawn("docker-compose", ["-f", composePath, "up", "-d"]);
```

```text
919:986:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
await this.waitForServicesHealthy(composePath, services, { timeoutMs: 5*60*1000, intervalMs: 2000 });
```

## Stop

- Unified services are stopped with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml down
```

```text
999:1037:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
spawn("docker", ["compose", "-f", composePath, "down"], { stdio: "inherit" });
```

## Logs integration

- Each service logs are streamed via `docker-compose logs -f <service>` and piped into the log viewer.

```text
1067:1079:src/modes/execution/services/DockerComposeManager.ts
spawn("docker-compose", ["-f", ..., "logs", "-f", serviceName])
```

## Files produced

- `docker-compose.unified.yml` (always when Docker/hybrid)
- Infra-only compose may also be generated by infra manager: `docker-compose.infra.yml`

```text
158:166:src/modes/execution/services/InfraServiceManager.ts
fs.writeFileSync(composePath, composeContent);
```

## Notes & recommendations

- Ports prefer stable host mappings from `ports-map.json`; falls back to `EXPOSE` if none.
- Infra dependencies are wired with `depends_on: { condition: service_healthy }`.
- Health waiting tolerates services without `healthcheck` by treating `running` as OK.
